# TaskMate-time tracking app
A time tracking app that helps you manage and organize your time in an efficient way. There are many apps available for that, but let me give you an idea

In this app, you can create different projects and tasks and set a time limit for each task. The app will allow you to record the start and end time of each task. In addition, you can track the break time and stop working as well.

The app can also display statistics on how you spend your time and the amount of time it takes on each project or task. You can also set time goals and monitor your progress towards achieving them.

In addition, the app can have a user-friendly and visual interface, which allows you to organize your tasks, prioritize, save time, and increase your productivity.
